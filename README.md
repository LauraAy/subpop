# SubPOP

The beta application for the Provenance Online Project (POP), based at the University of Pennsylvania. This application allows users to login create a profile, add information about books, and upload images of provenance (past ownership, such as bookplates or owner inscriptions) in those books. Users can then enter information identifying those provenance images.  Metadata and images are both stored to the POP database and pushed out to Flickr, where people can help identify unidentified images. 

This application was built for Penn Libraries using Ruby on Rails with an SQL database, by senior developer Doug Emery, with contributions from junior dev Laura Aydelotte.
